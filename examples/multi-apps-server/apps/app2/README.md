# Simple Web Server - 2

This version of the _simple web server_ has a `development` and `production` setup. 

> Based on which environment is active the server will show a different web page.

**NOTE:** there is no `.env` file here so if you try to run the application in isolation you should receive an error (if you didn't run the server already!).

It is up to the `server.yml` configurator file to setup the informations that are needed to run this application. Check it out!
